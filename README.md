# üü£ DOT Framework

Just another WordPress Plugin and Theme boilerplate with TailwindCSS, SASS, Blocks, ESLint, Prettier, and more.

## üìù Installation
- Create a new project `composer create-project artistudioxyz/dot-framework {projectname}`
  - or Include it as a dependency `composer require artistudioxyz/dot-framework`
- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Build assets `npx grunt`

### Note
One of the problem when working with Plugins in WordPress is that, you can't have the same namespace across multiple plugin. e.g `Dot\WordPress`.
Luckily there is a solution for that, you need to refactor the framework to use your project namespace,
but this process can be a tedious, because you'll need to refactor the namespace, setting, and configuration across multiple files.

Introducing [Aspri (Asisten Pribadi)](https://github.com/artistudioxyz/aspri), it is a simple library written in Go to help you refactor this framework and make it your own.
- To refactor this framework you can run : `aspri --wp-refactor --path {pathtoproject} --from Dot --to {Projectnamespace} --type {plugin|theme}`
  - or via grunt : `grunt shell:dot_refactor` (you need to set the `{Projectnamespace}` in `Gruntfile.js`)

## üìü Commands

- Generate original assets from `.min` in [`assets/build`,`assets/vendor`] : `grunt shell:original_assets`
- Install husky : `npx husky install`
