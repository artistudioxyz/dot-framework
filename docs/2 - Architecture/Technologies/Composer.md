## What is Composer?

Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP that simplifies the process of managing external libraries and packages in a PHP project. It allows developers to easily declare the dependencies their project needs and automatically installs and updates them.

With Composer, you can define the required PHP libraries and packages in a file called composer.json. This file contains a list of dependencies along with their version constraints. Composer then reads this file and fetches the required packages from the online PHP package repository called Packagist.
