## What is SASS?

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a popular and powerful CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of CSS. It provides additional features and functionalities that make writing and maintaining stylesheets more efficient and organized.

Key features of Sass include:
1. Variables: Sass allows developers to define variables that can be reused throughout the stylesheet. This makes it easier to manage colors, font sizes, and other styles, and provides consistency across the entire project.
2. Nesting: Sass allows CSS selectors to be nested within one another, reflecting the HTML structure and making the code more readable and maintainable.
3. Mixins: Mixins are reusable blocks of styles that can be included in multiple selectors. This helps to avoid repeating code and encourages modular and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding practices.
4. Functions: Sass provides built-in functions for performing calculations, manipulating colors, and other operations, allowing for dynamic and flexible styles.
5. Partials: Sass supports partial files, which are smaller, modular CSS files that can be included in the main stylesheet. This promotes code organization and separation of concerns.
6. Import: Sass allows styles to be split into multiple files and then imported into a single master file. This helps manage large projects and keeps related styles together.
7. Inheritance: Sass supports the concept of inheritance, where styles can inherit properties from other styles. This can lead to cleaner and more concise stylesheets.
